Description: Empirical Bayes shrinkage estimators are a weighted average between the subject-level observation and the group average.  The degree of weighting towards the group average is the ratio of within-subject variance to total (within-subject plus between-subject) variance.  In the context of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), within-subject variance over multiple sessions depends on both (1) the sampling variance associated with estimating the true RSFC of the current session and (2) variance in the true RSFC across multiple sessions.  Total within-subject variance is then the sum of sampling variance and intersession signal variance.  This function estimates sampling variance and uses intrasession signal variance as a proxy for intersession signal variance, as multiple sessions are rarely available.  The resulting shrinkage estimates will tend to be a better predictor of future RSFC from the same subject.  If the interest lies in producing the best estimate of RSFC for the current session (e.g. if state-level rather than trait-level effects of of interest), then samplingVarOnly=TRUE can be specified.  The degree of shrinkage is determined separately for each quantity of interest (e.g. connectivity strength for each pair of regions) but is shared across subjects.  All subjects are assumed to have the same time series length.
