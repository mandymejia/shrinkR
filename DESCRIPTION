Description: Empirical Bayes shrinkage estimators are a weighted average between
    the subject-level observation and the group average.  The degree of
    weighting towards the group average is the ratio of within-subject
    variance to total (within-subject plus between-subject) variance.
    In the context of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC),
    within-subject variance over multiple sessions depends on both (1) the
    sampling variance associated with estimating the true RSFC of the
    current session and (2) variance in the true RSFC across multiple
    sessions.  Total within-subject variance is then the sum of sampling
    variance and intersession signal variance.  This function estimates
    sampling variance and uses intrasession signal variance as a proxy
    for intersession signal variance, as multiple sessions are rarely
    available.  The resulting shrinkage estimates will tend to be a better
    predictor of future RSFC from the same subject.  If the interest
    lies in producing the best estimate of RSFC for the current session
    (e.g. if state-level rather than trait-level effects of of interest),
    then samplingVarOnly=TRUE can be specified.  The degree of shrinkage
    is determined separately for each quantity of interest (e.g.
    connectivity strength for each pair of regions) but is shared across
    subjects.  All subjects are assumed to have the same time series length.
